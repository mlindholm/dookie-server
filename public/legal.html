        <h2>Dookie Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="silver">Last updated: 2.3.2017</p>
        <p>Dookie has been created by Mathias Lindholm to help you keep track of your pet's eating and walking habits. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the app.</p>
        <p>Dookie does not require authentication by the user and joining a pet happens by entering a Pet ID. Dookie uses Google Firebase as a backend and an anonymous login is made for each user. There is no personal data stored to this account, it only gives you write access to the pet's database.</p>
        <p>Data for each pet is stored for 24 hours after which it is deleted. If you delete a pet it's gone and can't be undone. The data will not be available to users who may have joined your shared pet. Dookie and itâ€™s creator can not be held responsible for any incorrect data you may enter in the app.</p>
        <p>Like many apps, Dookie collects information that your device sends whenever you use the app. This log data may include information such as your device model, OS version, the time spent in the app, and other statistics. I use Google Firebase to collect, monitor and analyze this data.</p>
        <p>Your Personal Information will never be be used to spam you with email or marketing material.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2.3.2017 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me.</p>
